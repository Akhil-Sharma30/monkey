## Generating manual run command

A command to run the Agent manually can be generated by the Island Server UI by
going to the "Run Monkey" -> "Manual" page.

Any Agent, when run, needs to authenticate with the Island using a one-time
password (OTP) whose validity is 2 minutes. The commands on the
"Run Monkey" -> "Manual" page are updated with a valid OTP each time a command is
copied or the OTP expires.

### Downloading the Agent manually

Agent binaries can be downloaded by sending a `GET` request to
`https://[IP]:5000/api/agent-binaries/download/[OS]`, where `[IP]` stands for the IP
address of the Island Server and `[OS]` is either `windows` or `linux`.

### Running the Agent binary

The Agent binary must be started with either the `m0nk3y` or `dr0pp3r` flag.

The `m0nk3y` flag is the standard way to run the Agent.

The `dr0pp3r` flag invokes the Agent dropper. The dropper will move the Agent
binary to a location provided with the `-l` flag. Then, it will start the Agent
with the `m0nk3y` flag as a new process. Finally, the dropper will shut itself
down. This flag is useful if you want to detach the Agent from an exploited
service or parent process. It alleviates the need for the parent process to
wait until the Agent finishes.
