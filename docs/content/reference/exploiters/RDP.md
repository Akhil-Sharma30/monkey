### Description

This exploiter uses brute force to propagate to a victim through Remote Desktop Protocol.

See Microsoft's documentation for more on [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/termserv/remote-desktop-protocol).


##### Credentials used

The RDP exploiter can be run from both Linux and Windows attackers.
On both Linux and Windows attackers, the
exploiter uses all combinations of the [user-configured usernames and
passwords]({{< ref "/usage/configuration/credentials" >}}), as well as NT hashes for certain Windows verions that have been collected.
Different combinations of credentials are attempted in the following order:

1. **Brute force usernames and passwords** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and passwords that were set in the
   [configuration.]({{< ref "/usage/configuration/credentials" >}})


1. **Brute force usernames and NT hashes** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames that were set in the [configuration]({{< ref
   "/usage/configuration/credentials" >}}) and NT hashes that were
   collected from any other victims.

   This only works on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. You can read more
