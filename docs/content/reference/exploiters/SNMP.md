The SNMP exploiter exploits [CVE-2020-15862](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15862).


### Description

In versions 1 and 2c of the SNMP protocol the only means of authentication is the community string. In these versions of SNMP, community strings are sent as plaintext in all requests. If a community is configured with read-write access, the machine is vulnerable to an attack using NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB to run arbitrary commands on the victim.

This exploiter brute-forces machines by using usernames and passwords provided by the user (see [configuration]({{< ref "/usage/configuration" >}}) for instructions) as SNMP community strings.
