The Log4Shell exploiter exploits [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228).


### Description

Some versions of Apache Log4j, a Java logging framework, have a logging feature called “Message Lookup Substitution” enabled by default. This allows replacing certain special strings by dynamically-generated strings at the time of logging. If log messages or log message parameters can be controlled by an attacker, arbitrary code can be executed. The Log4Shell exploiter takes advantage of this vulnerability to propagate to a victim machine.
