The Infection Monkey has the capability of simulating a ransomware attack on your network.
All actions performed by the encryption routine are designed to be safe for production
environments.

To ensure minimum interference and easy recoverability, the ransomware simulation will encrypt
files if the user specifies a directory that contains files that are safe to encrypt.
If no directory is specified, no files will be encrypted.

## How are the files encrypted?

Files are "encrypted" in place with a simple bit flip. Encrypted files are renamed to have
`.m0nk3y` appended to their names.

This is a safe way to simulate encryption since it is easy to "decrypt" your files. You can simply perform a bit flip on the files again and rename them to remove the appended `.m0nk3y` extension.

This is sufficient for a ransomware simulation as your files are unusuable and are renamed with a different extension, similar to how many ransomwares act. These changes should trigger your security solutions.


## Which files are encrypted?

All regular files with [relevant extensions](#relevant-file-extensions-for-encryption) in the
configured directory are attempted to be encrypted during the simulation.

The simulation is not recursive, i.e. it will not touch any files in sub-directories of the
configured directory â€” only appropriate files in the top level of the tree.

Symlinks and shortcuts are ignored.


## Relevant file extensions for encryption

Encryption attempts are only performed on regular files with the following extensions.
