## Security in the Infection Monkey

The first time you launch Monkey Island (the Infection Monkey C&C server), you'll be prompted to create an account and secure your island. After account creation, the server will only be accessible via the credentials you entered.

If you want an island to be accessible without credentials, press *I want anyone to access the island*. Please note that this option is insecure, and you should only use it in development environments.

## Resetting your account credentials

This procedure is documented in [the FAQ.]({{< ref "/faq/#how-do-i-reset-the-monkey-island-password" >}})
