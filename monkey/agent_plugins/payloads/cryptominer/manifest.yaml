description: >-
  Simulates a cryptojacker running on your network using a set of configurable behaviors.

  To simulate cryptomining, you'll need to configure a time limit for the simulation,
  and how much CPU and memory to utilize on each infected machine. You can also instruct
  the Agent to send a dummy request (to the Island) with data that is usually identified by
  security solutions as cryptomining activity.
