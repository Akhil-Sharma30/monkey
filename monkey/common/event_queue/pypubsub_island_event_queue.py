        #       is new (hasn't been subscribed to before). If the topic is being subscribed to by

        #           > PyPubSub holds listeners by weak reference so that the lifetime of the
        #           > callable is not affected by PyPubSub: once the application no longer
        #           > references the callable, it can be garbage collected and PyPubSub can clean up
        #           > so it is no longer registered (this happens thanks to the weakref module).
        #           > Without this, it would be imperative to remember to unsubscribe certain
        #           > listeners, which is error prone; they would end up living until the
        #           > application exited.

        #       In our case, we're OK with subscribers living until the application exits. We don't
        #       provide an unsubscribe method (at this time) as subscriptions are expected to last
        #       for the life of the process.
        #
        #       Specifically, if an instance object of a callable class is created and subscribed,
        #       we don't want that subscription to end if the callable instance object goes out of
        #       scope. Adding subscribers to self._refs prevents them from ever going out of scope.
