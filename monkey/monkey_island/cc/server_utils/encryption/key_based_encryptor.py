# KeyBasedEncryptor is an encryption method which use random key of specific length
# and AES block cipher to encrypt/decrypt the data. The key is more complex
# one and hard to remember than user provided one. This class provides more secure way of
# encryption compared to PasswordBasedEncryptor because of the random and complex key.
# We can merge the two into the one encryption method but then we lose the entropy
# of the key with whatever key derivation function we use.
# Note: password != key
