It's called `get_victim_machines`. This function accepts an argument which limits how many machines the Monkey should find.\n\nWe want to make that value editable by the user instead of constant in the code.\n\n## Manual testing\n\n1. After you've performed the required changes, reload the Server and check your value exists in the Internal tab of the config (see image).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e0XAxuV.png)\n\n2. Set the new value to 1, and run Monkey locally (from source). See that the Monkey only scans one machine."
